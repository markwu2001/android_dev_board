# Project Objectives:

The aim of this project is to finally hack the smartphone. Smartphones are powerful, efficient, and highly integrated devices that can add tremendous value to an electronics prototype. Think of starting with a raspberry pi zero, $100 and lots of time later, you finally have your storage, TFT display, hardware inputs, power management, and cloud integration. But all of that is already integrated into the modern smartphone, so why canâ€™t we just use them? Outdated smartphones are becoming faster and faster and are approaching a point where consumers are throwing out powerful computing devices; reusing smartphones opens up doors for AI data processing as hardware trends also point in that direction. Software is not lagging behind with simple python tools being developed such as tensorflow. With this combination of technology, we can bring advanced computational power to beginners and make hardware more financially accessible.
